**`Flutter developer`**

I'm currently a Flutter full-stack developer. I made it here through an IT enginnering degree following with almost 4 years of professional experience to settle these last 2 years with Flutter technology. I'm highly interested with spiritual life which made me a "positive energy generator" and more connected to all the life aspects around us. I would love working and helping in some life changing ideas, with positive and serious people out there.
